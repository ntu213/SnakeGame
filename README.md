## What is Snake?

Snake is a **retro arcade game** where the player controls a **growing snake** that moves around the screen. The goal is to **eat food items**, which increase the snakeâ€™s length, while avoiding **collisions with walls and itself**. The challenge increases as the snake gets longer, requiring **quick reflexes and strategy** to survive. Snake is widely used as an **introductory project for game development** in programming.
